# Cards interface with API

Welcome to your React project, kickstarted with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## ðŸ›  Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You'll also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes for the best performance.\
The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.\
This command will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project, giving you full control.\
All commands except `eject` will still work, but they'll point to the copied scripts.

## Test Task Implementation Process

### Technology Stack

- Utilized Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.
- Employed React for building frontend components.
- Integrated Axios for efficient API request handling.

### Data Management

- Leveraged React state to manage and manipulate data on the frontend.

### Frontend Design

- Implemented a responsive design with 6 cards displayed in a row.
- Developed a "Load More" button to dynamically fetch and display additional cards.
- Ensured a sticky header for an improved user experience.

### Search Functionality

- Created a search bar allowing users to search cards by name.
- Implemented search functionality to filter and display relevant results.

### API Integration and Pagination

- Utilized Axios to fetch data from the API.
- Implemented API pagination with a limit of 12 cards per page.

### Version Control

- Utilized Git for version control, ensuring a structured and traceable code history.

### Deployment

- Deployed the application on Vercel for seamless hosting and accessibility.
